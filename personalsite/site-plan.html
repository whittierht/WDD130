      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Many websites are used to sell a product, but I believe that a website will only sell a product if 
        it demonstrates the product in such a way that the website sells itself first. I want my website
         to sell Video Games, but I want the website to first sell itself before it sells the product. 
         Doesn’t it make sense that if the website doesn’t first sell itself, then how will it sell its product? </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience are people who are looking to buy video games, so it needs to look geeky or nerdy!. </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      
      <h3>Why people will visit our site</h3>
      
      <p>
        People will come to my site to save money on their favorite video games. Our company will buy videos games when they are 
        on discount for a limited time, and then when the price goes back to normal we sell the games at the discounted price 
        with a little fee for profit, but it will still be less than it was before. This is how we will help people save money 
        while still making a profit! I also want people from all consoles to use the site!
      </p>
      
      <h3>Why people will trust us</h3>
      
      <p>
        The homepage will also state our purpose and how we help people save money. Doing a concrete explanation on how we are
        able to save people money will help our potential customers know that we are not a scam company. We will also put our
        social medias and customer service number for people who want to look us up more.
      </p>

      <h3>How it will look and feel</h3>

      <p>
        The the homepage will have links to all of the different pages! There will be 3 pages, one for the Home Page, one 
        for Video Games, and one for Puchases. By covering each console, more people will use our site just because of its diversity.
        Each link will be a picture o button that says something like "Save Now" or "Purchace" This will bring them to the respective page.
        There will also be links to each of these pages in the header.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since the website is meant specifically for those who play video games, the age range will most likley be 14-23 years old males.
        This website will be specifically tailored to appeal to video gamers. With a video games feel for the design. Not only will
        there be pictures of video games, but I also want the website to be very interactive since video games themselves are 
        active. When the customer hovers over a button, there will be some sort of transition and color change. I don't want these
        transitions to be immediate so they will most likley have a duration of less than half a second.
      </p>

      <p>
        I want to find an image that will work for the whole background, I'm not the biggest fan of the white background on most
        sites. The image will need to be simple, but also make it feel like the webiste is alive. It will probably be prominatly 
        white with some video game references.
      </p>

      <h3>Other Ideas</h3>
      <p>
        In a website like this, people will be buying things. I will most likley have a button
        by each video game that says "Buy Now and Save." This will bring them to the third page which is the purchace Page
      </p>
